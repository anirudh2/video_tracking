    "# Let’s say you are trying to use a noisy, blurred, low resolution, heavily quantized video feed to estimate the x,y position of a ball.  The primary objective is to estimate the position of the ball as accurately as possible, and as quickly as possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here is what we know:\n",
    "#     The field of view of the camera is dark (pixel intensity 0), except for a single ball with uniform brightness (pixel intensity 7) \n",
    "#     The ball is exactly 10 pixels in diameter, and has perfectly elastic collisions will the four “walls” bounding the square field of view of the camera\n",
    "#     There are no external forces acting on the ball (no gravity, no air resistance)\n",
    "#     The camera's CCD has 101x101 pixels, each with 3-bit intensity resolution [0,7] (greyscale)\n",
    "#     The camera’s CCD is noisy. Each pixel has noise ~unif(0,5).  This noise is uncorrelated from pixel to pixel, and frame to frame.\n",
    "#     The ball’s initial position is pixel [0,0] but its initial velocity vector is unknown. The maximum velocity is 7.5 pixels per frame.\n",

    "#         Plot of estimation accuracy vs frame count (does it converge? Any residual “steady state” error in the long run? Does performance depend on initial condition?)\n",
    "#         Some analytical justification for the simulation results you are seeing (did simulation agree with analytical? If so, why? If not, why not?)\n",
    "#         Estimate of total processing resources required to run your system in real time (MAC operations/frame)\n",
